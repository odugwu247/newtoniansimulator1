NewtonianSimulator is a tool designed to simulate Newtonian mechanics, allowing users to visualize and experiment with the principles of motion and forces. It typically incorporates Newton's laws of motion to model interactions between objects, making it useful for physics education and research. Some versions of Newtonian simulators enable users to adjust parameters like friction, gravity, and object properties to observe different outcomes
